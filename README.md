The Weather is an app specifically designed to help track the weather condition throughout the entire week. The app specifically will record the average temperature throughout the week and then tell us the minimum and maximum temperature and will record the specific weather conditions of that week. 

In the first screen, we have a splash screen which contains the start and exit buttons. The start button will take you to the next page which is the main page where the average will be displayed. The exit button however, will take you out of the app entirely and back to your home screen. 

In the main screen , which is the second page, this is where the average is calculated. We use the for oops in this case to display the different numbers that will be added together and then divided by the amount of days that the weather was recorded. There is also another button (the “Next Page” button) where it will take you to the third page of the app. At the very bottom, there is another exit button where it will take you out of the app entirely. 

Now we come to the very last page of the Weather App. This specific page will display our minimum, maximum and condition of the weather. At the very top, it states “Enter Day”. Here you will enter the day of the week and it will give you the specific stats of the weather conditions on that day. 

This app can be incredibly crucial and vital for many users for their day-to-day life. It is practical and it is pen for everyone's use
